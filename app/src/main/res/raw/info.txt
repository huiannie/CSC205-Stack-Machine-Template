This project is a template for the implementation of a stack machine.

As a demonstration, enter the expression:

VAR * VAR - ( VAR + VAR ) and press COMPILE.

The current program will convert the expression A*B-(C+D) into its postfix form and create a corresponding stack machine program.

At this point, enter some numbers as the values of the four variables (A, B, C and D) and press RUN after each entry.

Once the variables are set, the program may be stepped through by pressing consecutive RUNs.

However, if any other valid expressions are entered, the compilation will fail because this project has not been completed yet.

To complete this project, download the source code from GitHub https://github.com/huiannie/CSC205-Stack-Machine-Template, and rewrite the Compiler.java file so that the program may parse all expressions correctly.
