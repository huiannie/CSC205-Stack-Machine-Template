### Purpose

The CSC205 mobile app project templates are designed for CSC205 students who want to acquire hands-on experience with project development. Through developing this project, a student may:
* develop one or more skills in the areas of the test-driven development approach, UI, integration, client-server communication, project specifications;
* become familar with popular online developer communities and resources, such as Stackoverflow, GitHub, DevPost.

----
### System Requirements

This project is developed on Android Studio.
This app targets at Android machines of api level 18 and above.

----
### Skill Requirements

This project requires that the student has the equivalent of at least 3 semesters of programming training and familiarity with Java.

----
### About this project

This package provides the UI to support the implementation of a stack machine, which accepts algebraic expressions from the user, convert such expressions into the postfix form, and evaluate them.

----
### Demonstration

Download this project and compile it in Android studio. Or download an executable version from Play Store. Once installed, enter the expression:

VAR * VAR - ( VAR + VAR ) and press COMPILE.

The current program will convert the expression A*B-(C+D) into its postfix form and create a corresponding stack machine program.

At this point, enter some numbers as the values of the four variables (A, B, C and D) and press RUN after each entry.

Once the variables are set, the program may be stepped through by pressing consecutive RUNs.

However, if any other valid expressions are entered, the compilation will fail because this project has not been completed yet.

To complete this project, download the source code and rewrite the Compiler.java file so that the program may parse all expressions correctly.
